# IT Infrastructure Monitoring & Automation

## 1. Overview
This project implements a **real-time monitoring and automation system** for IT infrastructure, designed to proactively detect failures, optimize resource usage, and reduce downtime.

The solution is built to:
- Continuously monitor servers, network devices, and applications.
- Send alerts via email/SMS when predefined thresholds are exceeded.
- Execute automated recovery actions to restore services.
- Provide detailed performance and availability reports.

---

## 2. Objectives
1. **Proactive Monitoring** â€“ Detect issues before they impact users.
2. **Automated Recovery** â€“ Reduce human intervention during outages.
3. **Centralized Dashboard** â€“ Aggregate all monitoring metrics in a single interface.
4. **Scalable Design** â€“ Easily adapt to growing infrastructure.

---

## 3. Architecture
The architecture consists of:
- **Monitoring Server** (e.g., Zabbix/Nagios) for data collection and alerting.
- **Agent-based Monitoring** for detailed metrics on servers.
- **Database** for storing historical data.
- **Web Interface** for visualization and reports.
- **Automation Scripts** (Bash/PowerShell) for recovery actions.
